# E-commerce-Data-Warehouse
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on building a Data Warehouse (DW) and ETL pipelines for an E-Commerce business using Informatica PowerCenter and Oracle Database. The primary goal is to process raw flat file data (CSV), transform it, and load it into a structured Data Warehouse to answer key business questions related to customer behavior, order processing, logistics, and payments.

🎯 Business Needs Addressed
      The Data Warehouse helps answer critical business questions, including:
      ✅ Peak seasons and user order trends.
      ✅ Preferred payment methods and installment patterns.
      ✅ Customer spending time and purchase frequency per state.
      ✅ Logistics routes with heavy traffic and delivery delays.
      ✅ Impact of late deliveries on customer satisfaction.
